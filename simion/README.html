<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<h3>Extensions Made to the SDS Collision Model</h3>

<p>The interaction of the ions with the background gas is simulated here
using a modified version of the SDS collision model [3].
The model was extended to support field-dependent mobility
constants (see Field-depdenent Mobility below).  It also supports some
optional optimizations to allow the simulation to run faster such as
allowing the ion velocity to be defined directly according to the
mobility equation (see SDS FAIMS Mode below) and to allow more
efficient handling of large numbers of RF cycles (see Quick RF Cycles
Feature below).  The model is evaluated in our paper [14].</p>

<h3>Field-dependent Mobility (alpha and beta values)</h3>

<p>The original SDS model was modified to support mobility constants
(K) that depend on field (E):

<p class="equation">
K = K<sub>0</sub> * (1 + &alpha;(E/N)<sup>2</sup> + &beta;(E/N)<sup>4</sup>)
</p>

<p>N is the number density of gas particles.</p>

<p>The constants &alpha; and &beta; are specified in the m_defs.dat
file as additional columns.</p>

<p>
The mobility equation is normally stated as v<sub>t</sub>=KE, where E is the
electric field.  E is equivalently thought of as a force (F=q E) or
acceleration (a = F/m).  Though we usually assume that the
forces/accelerations are due to electric fields, we might generalize this to
any force, including magnetic fields and gravity, for example.  It is
convenient to input the ion's total acceleration into the mobility equation
(i.e. ion_a[xyz]_mm variables) rather than the electric field
(-ion_dvolts[xyz]_mm variables).  This is particularly the case since the
ion_dvolts[xyz]_mm variables only contain the electric field due to the
potentials arrays and neglect any electric fields due to charge repulsion.
By using the ion_a[xyz]_mm variables, we correctly handle charge repulsion
and as a side-effect possibly correctly handle the general cases of
other forces as well.
WARNING: the acceleration vector used here is non-relativistic.
</p>

<h3>Disabling Diffusion (SDS_diffusion = 0)</h3>

<p>
The diffusion effect causes ions to diffuse in random directions away from
their ideal trajectory defined by the mobility equation.  Normally, you want
diffusion effects enabled (SDS_diffusion = 1) because it is more realistic.
Diffusion effects typically require flying a sufficiently large number of
SIMION ions (e.g. a hundred) that is statistically representative of all real
ions in your system (possibly millions).
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it is helpful to disable diffusion effects (SDS_diffusion = 0) and
fly only a single ion.  This allows you to clearly and quickly see the average
behavior of the ions, ignoring deviations from the average behavior as due to
diffusion.
</p>

<div><b>Figure</b> Comparison of trajectories with (top) diffusion disabled and (bottom) diffusion enabled.</div>

<h3>Setting Time Step Size (wave_timesteps)</h3>

<p>
The time-step size for trajectory integration must be a sufficiently low
fraction of the RF period.  If this is not done, the ions will not accurately
experience the fields over the RF cycle, which are critical in FAIMS.  For
example, if the RF period (wave_period) is 2 microseconds, a time-step size
of 0.02 microseconds (i.e. 100 time-steps per RF period) might be good.
</p>

<p>
SIMION's time step size is normally controlled via the trajectory quality
(TQual) parameter, which is normally set to a low value such as 0 or 3.  A
value of 0 causes ions to advance approximately one grid unit per time step,
whereas a positive value like 3 also enables variable, self-adjusting
time-steps for improved accuracy (smaller time-steps) near field changes and
boundaries.
</p>

<p>The TQual parameter does not easy guarentee the condition above (small
fraction of the RF period).  Therefore, it is more convenient to set the
time-step size directly the user program.  The waveform libraries
(squarewavelib.lua and bisinusoidalwavelib.lua) both include a variable
wave_period that sets the RF period and a variable wave_timesteps that sets
the number of time-steps per RF period.
</p>

<p>To set wave_timesteps appropriately, it's recommend that you temporarily
disable diffusion effects (see above), allowing the RF behavior to be seen
more clearly, and gradually reduce wave_timesteps until trajectories converge.
If wave_timesteps is too small, trajectories will be innaccurate.  If it is
too large, trajectories will take needlessly long to calculate.  wave_times
steps generally has to be larger if fields change continuously over the RF
period, such as due to a continuous RF waveform (e.g. sinusoidal) or ions
experiencing fringe fields.  wave_timesteps may be set very small (e.g. 4)
if the fields are uniform and the RF is a rectangular wave (note:
squarewavelib.lua forces wave_timesteps to be 4 if it is set to a smaller
value).</p>

<p>
In the case of abrupt field transitions such as in a rectangular wave, it is
recommended to create a very small time-step that covers both sides of the
voltage transition.  squarewavelib.lua does it automatically with at least
four time steps: at least one time-step for the high field region, at least
one time-step for the low field region, and one very small time step each for
the two transition regions between the low and high fields.
</p>

<h3>Waveforms</h3>

<p>
Different types of waveforms can be applied to the FAIMS plates.  There is a
square wave (implemented via squarewavelib.lua), which is theoretically simple
to understand but not always convenient to generate in practice.  A simpler
approximation is a bisinusoidal wave [2] (implemented via bisinusoidallib.lua)
formed by the superposition of two sinusoidal waveforms.  You can easily
change the plates.iob example to use a bisinusoidal wave rather than a square
wave by editing plates.lua to import only the latter.
</p>


<img src="resources/waveforms.png" alt="square and bisinusoidal waveform plots">

<p>The bisinusoidal has the equation [2] of V_D(t) = [f sin wt + sin(hwt -
&phi;)] V_max / (f + 1), where V_max is the dispersion voltage, h=2,
&phi;=&pi;/2, and f = 2 (usually), 3, or 4.</p>

<h3>Theoretical Calculations Checks</h3>

<p>The &Delta;y change in ion position per RF cycle can be calculated
theoretically (<a href="resources/deltay-theo.pdf">here</a>) in an
idealized uniform field (given by the plates.iob example) with
diffusion effects disabled.  The theoretical results are given below
and agree with the SIMION results in plates.iob (found by 2D zooming
in on the two subsequent trajectory edges and measuring the y
displacement between them with the mouse as shown in the picture
below.)</p>

<h3>SDS FAIMS Mode</h3>

<p>
The mobility equation, v<sub>t</sub> = K E, defines an ion's terminal velocity
(v<sub>t</sub>) as a function of the field (E) at the ion's position.  If an
ion is always at terminal velocity, we can simply set the ion velocity to
v<sub>t</sub> at every time step.  However, if the field changes, such as if
the ion moves through a field gradient or the field is time-dependent (e.g. RF
waveform as in FAIMS), then there will be a short time period in which the ion
will accelerate/decellerate to the new terminal velocity.  An
order-of-magnitude estimate of this time is given by the <i>relaxation
time</i>, t<sub>rx</sub> (or, equivalently, distance &lambda;) [8]:

<p class="equation">
t<sub>rx</sub> = 2mK/q, &lambda; = (m/q)EK<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>
t<sub>rx</sub> represents an estimate of the time required for the ion to
accelerate from zero velocity to terminal velocity.  It is derived as the
quotient of the terminal velocity, v<sub>t</sub>=KE, and the estimated average
acceleration, (1/2)qE/m.
</p>

<p>
Of critical importance in FAIMS is how t<sub>rx</sub> compares to the period
in which the field changes significantly--that is one RF period or one time
step in an RF period.  In many typical FAIMS conditions, such as small to
mid-sized ions in N<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>rx</sub> is on the
order of 0.1-1 ns, while it reaches ~13 ns for a certain large ion in a highly
mobile medium (apomyoglobin protein ion in He) [9].  This is a small
percentage of a typical FAIMS RF period of 1 microsecond or so (1 MHz), though
it might not be entirely negligible.
</p>

<p>
The modified SDS model supports two modes.  The FAIMS mode (SDS_faims_mode =
1), forces ion velocity to be defined according to the mobility equation at
every time step.  The normal mode (SDS_faims_mode = 0), attenuates ion
acceleration according to a Stokes' law with drag coefficient tuned to give
terminal velocity consistent with the mobility equation.  The normal mode is
more general and <i>can</i> model ion movement even over the relaxation
processes. The downside is that the normal mode <i>must</i> accurately model
the relaxation process.  This involves using a sufficient number of trajectory
integration time steps over the relaxation period to accurately model the
relaxation process.  Since this period can be very small in FAIMS
(t<sub>rx</sub> &lt;&lt; RF period), the time-steps can be very small too,
which implies lots of time-steps and long integration run times.  SIMION's
variable-sized, self-adjusting time steps (preferrably TQual &ge; 3, the
default), corrects for this somewhat, especially in making the time-steps near
sharp field transitions (e.g. rectangular wave edges) very small.  In FAIMS,
it's usually sufficient and more efficient to use the FAIMS mode.
</p>

<h3>Space Charge, Magnetic Fields, and Other Accelerations</h3>

<p>
The mobility equation, K = v/E * ..., requires an electric field (E = - grad
V) as input.  We could input the electric field computed from the SIMION
potential arrays (i.e. -ion_dvolts[xyz]_mm variables), but this may ignore
some other types of acceleration.  These variables do not include electric
fields from the charge repulsion effect.  (They do if the Poisson solver is
used because there the effect of space-charge is incorporated directly into
the potentials of the refined potential array.)  These variables also ignore
forces from magnetic fields and any other force you might add (e.g. gravity).
Now, we do have a total non-relativistic acceleration (ion_a[xyz]_mm
variables) accessible inside the accel_adjust segment segment, which
incorporates all these forces.  (Note "Trick 1" mentioned under "The
accel_adjust Program Segment" in Section "L.2.6 Program Segments, Details" of
the SIMION 8.0 manual and also the flow chart in <a
href="http://simion.com/issue/304">issue 304</a>).  The SDS-FAIMS model
re-expresses this total acceleration (a) in terms of an equivalent potential
gradient (grad V) using the Lorentz force law: m*a = F = q * -grad V.  Note
that "a" (i.e. ion_a[xyz]_mm variables) actually incorporates all acceleration
forces (charge repulsion, electric field and magnetic field), not just
electric field (-ion_dvolts[xyz]_mm) forces.  This potential gradient vector
is then fed into the mobility equation.
</p>

<p>Note that if SDS_faims_mode == 1, the accel_adjust segment forces the
acceleration vector to be zero (ion_a[xyz]_mm = 0) and the other_actions
segment forces the velocity to be the terminal velocity (ion_vx_mm, ion_vy_mm,
and ion_vz_mm) defined by the mobility equation.  If SDS_faims_mode == 0, then
the accel_adjust segment attenuates the SIMION computed acceleration to apply
a Stokes' law drag equivalent to the mobility constant.  In both cases, the
"total" acceleration (charge repulsion + electric field + magnetic field)
is utilized in the mobility equation.
</p>

<p>There are two ways to handle space-charge in SIMION: the <a
href="../repulsion/README.html">charge-repulsion</a> feature (which
superimposes an additional "repulsion" acceleration on particle trajectory
integration) and the <a href="../poisson/README.html">Poisson solving</a>
feature (which is more general and causes the field calculation to take
space-charge into account).  For the time being, the first approach is much
more practical.  Normally, you would use the equivalent Colombic or factor
forms of the charge repulsion, not beam repulsion here.  Note that the Poisson
solver currently does not support fast adjust (.PA#) potential arrays.  You
can use a basic potential array (.PA), and programatically re-refine many
times over the RF cycle, though this can be very computationally intensive.
This is a possible area for future improvement tough.
</p>

<p>As an example of using repulsion effects, load plates.iob, load the
repulsion2.fly2 particle definitions (which defines 500 ions with
random Y and Z positions and random time of birth (TOB) in the X
direction.  Optionally set the adjustable variable SDS_diffusion = 1
to enable diffusion (which reduces Coulombic repulsion), set the
wave_timesteps variable to 20, in the Particles tab, set TQual to 0,
enable Grouped flying, set Repulsion to Coulombic with a huge
repulsion amount like 1E-12 C (i.e. 1E-12 C per 300 &mu;sec TOB range
= 3.3 nA), and enable "Dots" trajectory display using maximum dot
speed (nearby slider control moved to top).  Fly ions.  Note that
excess charge tends to hit the electrodes early on near the front of
the FAIMS cell, thereby thinning out the space-charge further down in
the FAIMS cell and reducing the charge repulsion further down.  This
is shown in the figure below.  Now reduce repulsion to a more
realistic value like 1E-15C (i.e. 3.3 pA), or turn it off entirely,
and fly again.  Note that the repulsion is now minimal compared to the
diffusion effect.  Particles don't hit electrodes until further down
in the FAIMS cells, where some ions have enough time to reach the
electrodes due to diffusion.  The effects of charge repulsion and
diffusion have some similarities.  Both tend to push ions further
apart.  However, they are not exactly the same either; by Coulomb's
law, the repulsion effect is much greater when ions are close
together.</p>

<img src="resources/repulsion.png" alt="repulsion effect">
<div><b>Figure:</b> Repulsion effect.  Note that particle splats on 
electrodes are concentrated near the FAIM entrance (left).</div>

<h3>Quick RF Cycles Feature (SDS_quick_cycles &gt; 0)</h3>

<p>The following is an advanced "quick RF cycles" option that can greatly
speed up the simulation if ions experience a large number of RF cycles.  It is
safest to keep this option disabled (SDS_quick_cycles = 0) unless you fully
understand the implications.</p>

<p>
If an ion experiences multiple RF cycles over a short net displacement
traveled, and the environment over which the ion travels in each of those
cycles is nearly identical (because the RF cycles are identical and the ion
remains in nearly the same location in the system at a given phase of the RF
cycles), then we can assume that the net displacement of the ion is nearly
identical in each of those cycles.  We can therefore trace the ion's
displacement, in the normal way, over one RF cycle and then simply multiply
that displacement by the number of RF cycles in the group to obtain the
displacement over all RF cycles in the group without actually tracing the ion
through those additional RF cycles.  This can improve speed by a factor of
nearly the number of RF cycles in the group.
</p>

<p>
Now, the diffusion effect observed by a single ion over multiple RF cycles is
not identical in each of the cycles.  In one cycle, the ion might be propelled
forward by diffusion; in the next cycle it might be propelled backward.
Diffusion is a random walk, where each step in the way is randomized and
independent.  The diffusion effect over N cycles is, on average, only sqrt(N)
times that over a single cycle (see "random walk"), not N times as would occur
in the approach above.  Therefore, we have two possible solutions.  We could
reduce the diffusion effect in the first cycle by a factor of 1/sqrt(N), in
which case multiplying it by N gives the desired sqrt(N).  Alternately, we may
disable diffusion effects in the first cycle, multiply the displacement by N,
and only then separately add the diffusion for N total cycles.
</p>

<p>The adjustable variable "SDS_quick_cycles" is the number of RF cycles in
the group minus one (the first cycle).  SDS_quick_cycles is a non-negative
integer.  Setting it to 0 effectively disables the feature, and all ions are
traced normally.  Setting it to -1 takes special meaning, in which case the
program chooses a value automatically so that the mobility displacement
(ignoring diffusion) is approximately one grid unit over all RF cycles in the
group.  This conservatively assumes that the environment over a grid unit
doesn't change much.  The adjustable variable "SDS_quick_period" is the period
of one RF cycle in microseconds.  This variable may be set automatically by
your program (the squarewavelib.lua and bisinusoidalwavelib.lua routines do
this for you automatically)</p>

<p>Do not set the SDS_quick_cycles value so high that the particle travels
such a distance that different RF cycles would see a non-trivial
difference in fields (e.g. when traveling over a region where fields are
changing).  Also note that increases to SDS_quick_cycles increases the jump
distance per time-step of the diffusion effect.  This may make the diffusion
effect appear very choppy.  In fact, it could cause the ion to jump over
electrodes.  For these reasons, SDS_quick_cycles should usually be kept to a
small value, even 0.  You may increase it to increase simulation speed if
doing so doesn't significantly affect the results.</p>

<p>See collision_sds.lua code for further details on this feature.</p>

</div>

<h3>Non-uniform Gas Flow</h3>

<p>
The examples by default assume an uniform velocity gas flow profile between the
FAIMS plates.  This is less than realistic and can be changed.</p>

<p>The flow profile in general can be complex and not have a simple
analytical form.  The flow is in general governed by the Navier-Stokes
equation [6], which can be solved numerically by computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) programs.  Under simplified (idealized) conditions, we
can also solve it analytically.  A planar FAIMS can be approximated as
two infinite parallel plates, which has an analytical solution.  A
cylindrical FAIMS can be approximated as two infinite concentric
cylinders, whose gap locally resembles infinite parallel plates
(or we can use the more exact equation in [10].  </p>

<p><b>Laminar flow between infinite plates</b>: For laminar viscous
flow between two infinite parallel plates with gap distance H in y
direction, constant pressure gradient (dp/dx) in the x direction, and
dynamic viscosity &mu; (i.e. Poiseuille [4] planar flow), the
Navier-Stokes equation implies [5] that the flow is in the x direction
with velocity of</p>

<p class="equation">
u(y) = -(1/2)&mu;<sup>-1</sup> (dp/dx) y (H - y)
</p>

<p>As seen the velocity has a <i>parabolic</i> profile between the
plates, with maximum velocity (u<sub>max</sub>) at the mid-point
(y=H/2) between the plates and zero velocity on the plates.  We can
relate u<sub>max</sub> to dp/dx by direct result (setting y=H/2):</p>

<p class="equation">
u<sub>max</sub> = -(1/8)&mu;<sup>-1</sup> H<sup>2</sup> (dp/dx)
</p>

<img src="resources/parabolic_flow.png" alt="parabolic profile in gas flow">
<div><b>Figure:</b> Parabolic profile in gas flow.</div>

<p>The mean fluid velocity u<sub>m</sub> = (2/3)u<sub>max</sub>.
Multiply this by the cross-sectional area to get the volumetric
flow rate.</p>

<p>The above equation holds under laminar (not turbulent) flow regimes.
The regime can be described by the Reynolds number,</p>

<p class="equation">
Re = u<sub>m</sub>D/&nu;,
</p>

<p>where &nu; = &mu;/&rho; is called the "kinematic viscosity", &rho; is fluid
density, u<sub>m</sub> is the mean velocity, and D is the diameter (which is
the distance between plates in the case of parallel plates).  The flow starts
becoming turbulent, and the equations start to fail, at (critical) Reynolds
numbers above roughly 2000 or so [11].</p>

Note: dynamic viscosity (&mu) of air at 298 K is 1.861E-5 Pa s [7].
density (&rho;) of dry air at 0 C, 1 atm is about 1.2929 kg
m<sup>-3</sup> [12] or, by the ideal gas law, 1.1845 kg m<sup>-3</sup> at 298
K.  Therefore, for air at 1 atm and 298 K, &nu; = &mu;/&rho; = 1.571E-5
m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<p>
In the case of plates.iob, using maximum velocity of 6.667 m/s, Re = 141,
which is a laminar condition.
</p>

<p>
According to [13] (p. 5.3), the hydrodynamic entrance length L<sub>hy</sub> is
defined as the axial distance required to attain 99% of the ultimate fully
developed maximum velocity if the flow entering the plates is uniform.  In the
case of parallel plates, L<sub>hy</sub>/(2D) = 0.011 (2Re) + 0.315/(1 + 0.0175
(2Re)) (p. 5.62).  In the plates.iob example (Re = 141), we therefore have
L<sub>hy</sub> = 6.3 D.

(for cross sectional area A=4ab and perimeter P=4(a+b).</p>

<p>Reference [13], Chapter 5, contains equations of flow for various

<b>Defining analytical flow in SDS:</b>
An analytical flow (e.g. Poiseuille) can be defined in SDS.
Uncomment the Poiseuille section of code in plates.lua
or cylindrical_plates.lua.
</p>

<p>To see the effect, load cylindrical_plates.iob, load the
"y_range.fly2" particle definitions (particles starting at a range of
radial positions, and reduce the wave_period adjustable variable to
0.5 (smaller cycles that are easier to distinguish).  The result on a
an symmetric 2D zoom are shown below.  Note that particles closer the to center
(where gas velocity is higher) move a larger distance per RF cycle.</p>

flow. (Note: diffusion effect disabled for easier viewing.)</div>


<p>
A numerically calculated flow (e.g. via external CFD software) can also
be inputted into SDS.  Export a 1D, 2D, or 3D grid of
flow data points from the CFD software and load that into SDS
(see SDS code for details).

<h2>Changes</h2>

<pre>
2009-10-16
  - README.html - Add repulsion example discussion (including repulsion.fly2).
  - README.html - Fix equation for Reynold's number.
  - README.html - Add discussion of flow in rectangular duct.

2009-07-08
  - Fixed SDS_quick_cycle was broken under reruns (e.g. spectrum.iob).
  - Fixed squarewavelib.lua tstep_adjust (broken in 2009-07-07)
  - collision_sds.lua - SDS.temperature, SDS.pressure, and
      SDS.velocity/_x/_y_/_z, if functions,
      are now passed x,y,z coordinates in workbench mm units by default.
  - collision_sds.lua - If function SDS.init is defined by the user,
      it is called at the beginning of SDS initialization.
  - Extracted Non-uniform flow code into new flowlib.lua file.
  - Add excel_enable option to spectrum.lua.

2009-07-07
  - New SDS_diffusion adjustable variable
    (replaces SDS_enable == 2 or 3)
  - Eliminated _G.transition variable (not needed).
  - Fixed viscosity of air: 1.861E-5 Pa s (not 1.861E-3).
  - Fixed: field-dependent mobility K was
    ignored under SDS_faims_mode == 0.
  - Expanded README sections: Field-dependent Mobility,
    Disabling Diffusion (SDS_diffusion = 0), Setting
    Time Step Size (wave_timesteps), SDS FAIMS Mode, Use of Acceleration
    Forces in the Mobility Equation, Reynolds number.

2009-07-02
  - Added idealized cylindrical FAIMS (plates_cylindrical.iob).
  - Added Poiseuille parabolic velocity flow profile option to Lua files.

2009-06-27
  - fixed charge repulsion and magnetic field handling for
    SDS_faims_mode == 1.  Previously, these accelerations were forced to 0.
  - print SDS_enable value at beginning of run in collision_sds.lua.
  - expanded README.html docs on quick RF feature

2009-06-26 - added "quick RF cycles" feature to collision_sds.lua.
  This can speed up the calculation if there are a large number
  of RF cycles over a short distance traveled.  See comments above.

2009-06-19 - plates.lua - make x_max adjustable and
  print log message if particles stopped due to x > x_max.

2009-06-19 - add plates.iob theoretical calculation comparison to
  documentation.

2009-06-18 - collision_sds.lua - in other_actions, don't bypass
  diffusion effect when _G.transition enabled.  We no longer
  assume transition time-step size is so small that diffusion
  is negligible (note: _G.transition may be true for every time step
  for continuously varying waveforms).

2009-06-18 - added bisinusoidal wave (bisinusoidalwavelib.lua).
  This can be enabled in plates.iob by editing the plates.lua.
